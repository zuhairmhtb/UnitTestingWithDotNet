# Unit Testing with .Net

We were taught a lot of stuff at our university - starting from the basic concepts of programming languages followed by data structure and algorithms leading up to the development of web applications.

Then I started developing personal web application projects for fun and learning purposes. But I always concentrated on developing the application itself. Finally, when I started my job, I got involved in developing web applications that follow modern industry standards.

One thing I learned from my work experience is that the development of the application itself is just a part of the entire system. An important aspect of programming is testing our code. We usually learn the concept of unit testing at universities but the topic is not prioritized as it should have been.

When I interact with other programmers in our country, it becomes clearer that no matter how good a person can code, many among them always struggle to write tests for their code. I can only assume that the reason for it is our unfamiliarity with unit tests and lack of practice in writing unit tests. Because of it, we always struggle to write unit tests when we start working with production-grade applications.

During my early days of writing unit tests, one of the two questions that bothered me the most was, "how should I construct my test cases, and what should exactly test?" The other question was, "how many scenarios do I cover before I can say that I have completed writing test cases for one functionality? At what point do test cases become too many test cases?"

I have been developing monolithic and microservice-based web applications with [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) framework for a while now. In this article, I would therefore like to discuss the basics of unit testing and show the comparison between two popular testing frameworks of .Net - [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) and [Machine.Specifications](https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications). I have developed a console application containing the test cases that I will discuss in this article. To easily run the application, I have [dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) the entire application. All you need is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Preferably 2019 or above). You can find my code [here](https://github.com/zuhairmhtb/UnitTestingWithDotNet). You can clone the repository, open the solution in Visual Studio, and hit the 'Run' button. Docker will download the required [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages and run the application. To run the test cases, open 'Test Explorer' and just hit the 'Run all' button. Both MSpec and XUnit tests should run properly.
